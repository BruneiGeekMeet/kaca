KACA was created to increase the welfare of disabled children in Brunei Darussalam whom have not had any formal training or education. KACA provides guidance programs and special training so the children can live independently and are capable in furthering their studies in normal schools.

The main objective of KACA is to create a training institute and set a benchmark for program facilities and activities in Early Development Program and Special Education for children.

**Problem**
- Lack of youth volunteers to help KACA during events and care for the special needs.
- Lack of fund raising or donation platform for KACA.
